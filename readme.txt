Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
The program is about DNA and how it can be reversed. The program asks for the user to enter
a DNA sequence (though it could work for RNA sequence or any other type of lettering sequence)
and a pattern. The program spits out the prefix, marker, middle (between the index of the marker 
and reverse marker), reverse middle, reverse marker, suffic, and the result.

Not such a bug, but a limitation: if all the letters in the DNA sequence were to be the same.
